<h2 class="section-heading">Net Zero by 2050</h2>

<p> Expanding renewables, electrification, energy efficiency and emission reduction will only bring us part-way:
    To achieve net zero by 2050, we need to decarbonise all industries. This means building a circular carbon
    economy where carbon dioxide is used as a building block to make useful chemicals and fuels. However, the technology
    is not there yet.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Dunia's mission</h2>

<p> We have named the company 'Dunia Innovations' (Dunia from Arabic دُنْيا stands for ‘World’) as we strive for impact
    and want to develop the innovations the world needs the most.</p>
<p> Have you ever wondered about the carbon footprint you are leaving daily?</p>

<p> From buying your favourite clothes to surfing the web, all our actions carry a carbon footprint.
Imagine a carbon-neutral world where our actions do not damage the planet we live on.

    Day-to-day products made from CO<sub>2</sub>
</h2>


<p>What is holding us back from utilising CO<sub>2</sub> to its full potential are inefficient catalysts.

<span class="caption text-muted">Current bottleneck in carbon utilisation is inefficient catalysts.</span>

<p>Current innovation in catalysis has not changed much in the past century and with the current paradigm it will be too
    late for our climate targets. Dunia aims to disrupt catalyst discovery by leveraging the 21<sup>st</sup> century AI and robotic
    tools. Our platform technology supercharges the catalyst innovation process, reducing time and cost to market by up
    to 90%. More importantly, our approach has the potential to enable GHGs emission reduction on a gigaton scale per
    annum.</p>
