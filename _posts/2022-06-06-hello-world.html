<h2 class="section-heading">Net Zero by 2050</h2>

<p> In order to achieve net zero by 2050, efforts were made to improve carbon capture and direct air capture technology.
    However, not much efforts were put into carbon utilisation where the the carbon dioxide is used as building blocks to
    make useful chemicals and fuels.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Dunia's mission</h2>

<p> The word 'Dunia' means 'world' and we have named the company 'Dunia Innovations' as we believe it is our mission
    to provide the innovations the world needs most.
</p>
<p> Have you ever wondered the carbon footprint you are leaving daily? </p>
<p> From transportation, buying your favourite clothes to surfing the web carry a carbon footprint. Imagine a world
    where none these activities carry carbon any footprint.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">
    We believe it is not enough to just capture and store the CO<sub>2</sub>. Instead, CO<sub>2</sub>
    should be used as components to build day-to-day products.
</h2>


<p>The reason CO<sub>2</sub> is not utilised to its full potential currently is due to inefficient catalysts.

<span class="caption text-muted">Current bottleneck in carbon utilisation is inefficient catalysts.</span>

<p>Current innovation in catalysis has not changed much in the past century where it is done in a bottom-up
approach with highly-biased data.</p>

<p>Dunia leverages the 21<sup>st</sup> century AI and robotic tools to supercharge the catalyst innovation which would
speed up the process 10x and reduce the cost of innovation 3x. More importantly, our approach has the potential to
reduce GHGs emission in gigatonnes scale per annum.</p>
