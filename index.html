<h2 class="section-heading">Net Zero by 2050</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:100%;">
Expanding renewables, electrification, energy efficiency and emission reduction will only bring us part-way:
    To achieve net zero by 2050, we need to decarbonise all industries. This means building a circular carbon
    economy where carbon dioxide is used as a building block to make useful chemicals and fuels. However, the technology
    is not there yet.
